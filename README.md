# Notes

A living repository of notes that I can access anywhere. These notes used to be a private collection, and now public to share with friends and collogues. I foresee that this repository will grow quickly and I am attempting establish some order before it gets out of control. As I am copying old notes they are being refactoring to markdown as I go. Some are quick, while others require some testing to review relevance and if they are outdated.
